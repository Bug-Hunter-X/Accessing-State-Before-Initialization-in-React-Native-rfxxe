To fix this, you can use a conditional rendering to avoid accessing the state variable until it has been initialized. Or you can use an asynchronous operation to make sure that the state has been updated before you try to access it.  The example below shows how to use a conditional rendering to fix the problem:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Simulate an asynchronous operation to fetch data
    setTimeout(() => {
      setData({ name: 'John Doe' });
    }, 1000);
  }, []);

  if (data === null) {
    return <Text>Loading...</Text>;
  }

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Name: {data.name}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```

This code uses the `useEffect` hook to fetch data asynchronously.  The `data` state variable is initialized to `null`, and a conditional render checks if it is null. If it is, a loading message is displayed.  Once the data is fetched, the component re-renders and displays the data.
