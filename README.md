This repository contains a demonstration of a common error in React Native development: accessing a state variable before it has been initialized.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The error typically manifests as unexpected behavior or crashes.  This example highlights the importance of proper state management in React Native applications and demonstrates a common solution involving conditional rendering or asynchronous operations.
